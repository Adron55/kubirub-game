## Kubirub

KubiRub is a mobile game of a digital version of the 3D Rubik’s Cube hand toy. What makes it different from all other similar games is the fact that KubiRub holds the logos of companies on its sides rather than colours. These logos are distributed among 6 sides by 9 times. Users get discounts or prize coupons by solving a single face of the cube, from the company which they gathered its 9 logos together.:
